<h1>Cyber Defense Project 1</h1>
<h2>Analyze a Remote Intrusion Attempt</h2>

<h3>Project Scenario</h3>
- Another analyst in our security operations center has seen evidence of a remote intrusion attempt on one of our client's infrastructures—a private network belonging to a long-time client AT-USA—and has captured a PCAP of the suspicious activity. I’d like you to analyze the PCAP and confirm or disconfirm malicious activity. I'd also like you to corroborate your initial conclusions by analyzing log data within the SIEM...not sure how well the activity was recorded in AT-USA's logging setup, but let's see if that adds any additional context to the event. <br>
- I'd like your report to be in SBAR (Situation/Background/Assessment/Recommendation) format—but since you're new to using the SBAR format, use the provided worksheet to document your investigation findings for now.
